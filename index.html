    <h1> optical computer mouse </h1>

    <p>optical computer mouse was invented by two different people in 1980. it uses a camera to take pictures of the surface below and then sends digital signal to the computer to tell it which direction the mouse is moving in. you can't use it on a glass table. </p>
