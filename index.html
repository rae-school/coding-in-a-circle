This was the first computer to make its calculations in real time (Edwards). Before the Whirlwind, computers would take really long periods of time to process a program and would then require the physical adjustment of switches or punched cards, a re-programming, in order to run a process again. Originally designed as a flight simulator, the Whirlwind was able to receive inputs and produce outputs using a three-dimensional array of magnetic core memory. Magentic core memory is a kind of hardware and software design using magnetic wires which allowed for a program to be stored even if power was lost...so if the computer was turned off, the programming of the wires would still be intact. This technology was used in tandem with vacuum tube screens which in itself allowed for a graphical interface of computed data. **Jacob Gaboury** on the history of the computer screen writes “The screen is not simply an enduring technique or evocative metaphor; it is a hardware object whose transformations have shaped the material conditions of our visual culture.” ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

This is where the mouse’s predecessor, the light pen, materialized (Edwards). At the time of the light pen, computers were already much more than calculating machines, but they were not yet ubiquitously used for purposes outside of the military. The screen was still thought of as a substrate like paper, the analog substrate for tracking and storing, and the light pen was the next best iteration of moving from the analog act of writing to the digital act of pointing. In this sense, the problem of computing became not only the act of programming switches but also the act of moving on along x and y coordinates. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

In one direction the idea was to build up an autonomous intelligence that would match or even supersede human intelligence. The question, by the way, of “what intelligence actually is” still stands and in step with philosopher Hubert Dreyfus I think that artificial intelligence has proven to show us what computer can't do than what they can. In the other direction, a person named Douglas Engelbart led a research lab called the Augementation Research Center which sought to create a kind of intelligent symbiosis ~between~ the human and the computer. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

Presented to the public as what later became known as “the mother of all demoes” the system that Engelbart and his colleagues built included some of the earliest versions of hyperlinks, multiple windows, real-time cross-computer collaboration (which is what we will be doing today), and finally, the use of a mouse. It was an amalgamation of devices, all situated within optimal distance for the hand to the mouse, the eyes to the screen. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

So, when I’m coding something, I’m often coding on top of someone else’s code, in someone else’s software, on top of the software that makes up my operating system which is permanently baked into the proprietary silicon chip of my Apple computer. Computers at their core still consist of a complex series of on and off switches, ones and zeroes except now the switches are like an extremely tiny mix of analog and digital signals and are nearly invisible to the human eye. This means that everything we do on our computers today is already abstracting away those complex patterns of numbers in order for us to use them in the way that we do. So these abstractions allow us to do things like writing text in a file, without thinking about how or even if the computer will be able to do this. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

When programmers were writing code for computers the size of rooms the time it took to run the program was really expensive, so people were always writing code that was most efficiently read by the computer itself not by the people who were making the programs. This reflects how code is written today, often illegible to the untrained eye and minified into difficult to read blobs of text. This is why coding is intimidating, it seems to be a problem of language, some kind of insider’s club, but really a lot of the original languages from the 70s, 80s and 90s are still the foundation upon which so much code is written. As an example, today when someone builds a website the might use a mix of languages like Ruby, JavaScript and Python and then uses a mix of libraries and frameworks which someone else has written to compile all of it, it is still into the only three readable languages by the browser HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and these three languages of have maintained the same basic syntax since the mid-90s when they were created. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

The idea of a file inside a folder on a desktop...and then there's the trashcan. When you put something in the trash, does it ever really go away? And what is the file really? And what is the folder? Folders aren't actually anything.

When the computer finally obeys their commands, they are granted with this feeling of immense gratification and power. We have all felt this feeling of gratification after hours and hours of trying to debug something we wrote. It’s a cyclical command and response from you to your computer. And I think this cyclical command and response is worth thinking about as a form of work, what other kinds of processes are like this? How does the structure of this kind of work affect when we end up making? ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->

It makes me wonder what it would be like if programmers had to press the keys of their keyboards so gently that it required them to move extremely slow and therefore with care? This is the kind of coding I want us to do today, we can call it hand coding. It is a way to code which is not dependent on someone else’s software or framework or library, you are writing in the language that the browser understands, and the language that has been used since the 90s to make websites. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙  So I’m kind of lying to you here because your browser is software but hand coding in the software of the browser is what I like to call closer to the metal of your computer then doing something like making a Wordpress website which is software on a big server depending on fragile code written by tons and tons of people and then minified into HTML CSS and Javascript. Not that this is bad or good but I’m interested in questioning relationships around the transparency, encoding and decoding, file systems, and proprietaryness of computing and doing something like hand coding is a step towards new questions about our relationships to these things. As a reminder, the browser is software which translates HTML and CSS into web pages. Your browser is the performer of the program you are writing. ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ -->
