                  The reading by Bardini gave an overview of the progress of computer science in the 1960s, specifically focusing on the Augmentation Research <b>Center</b>. The author positions the ARC as an extremely influential and innovative space that made many unprecedented developments. For example, the use of hyperlinks by the ARC distinguished them as ahead of their time. Further, they publicly debuted the first application of the mouse during their presentation in 1968. This made me think about how many technologies are presented ahead of their time and do not actually begin to be used by the public for a long time. One <button>aspect</button> I also thought about is how much money it took for the presentation to take place and how it was funded in part by the government. This brings in broader questions of government spending: what is the US government willing to spend on the advancement of technology? Could that money be spent in other areas for better use? Further, one of the presenters said that the funders were pretty hands-off when it came to determining what the funding was <i>spent</i> on. This could be beneficial as it allows for more creative freedom and accomplishments such as the 1968 presentation. On the other hand, it would be easy for the money to be misspent if put into the wrong hands.

                  Chapter five of Bootstrapping by <mark>Thierry Bardini</mark> focused on the technical development of the oN-Line System at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). While I agree with what some have said, that the jargon and word choice of the paper is a bit unapproachable if you’re not already in the software space— I do think the reading did a good job of providing insight on a topic I knew nothing about. The oN-Line System introduced parts of the digital web that we wouldn’t think twice about today like hypertexts and the mouse. It’s interesting to imagine these ideas being developed because now they feel like such an ingrained part of our digital society, but without them we wouldn’t be where we are today or learning in the way that we do in school!

              For a while it was hard, until '65 and '66 when we started getting some that were
